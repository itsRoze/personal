# Why VS Code

My first code editor was Notepad. Yep, that old school Windows program that you can use to write a quick note. Making simple websites with HTML and CSS was a breeze. I could write my code, save it, and open it in my browser to see the results. It was a great way to learn the basics of web development.

But, Notepad++ was my first real code editor. It was a free download that allowed me to write code in a more organized way. I could write my code in different colors, and it had a built-in preview that would show me what my code would look like in the browser.

When I was learning Java, I got into IDEs like BlueJ and Eclipse.

In college, I used Emacs and fell in love with the simplicity. I would run into Vim users who would tell me that I should switch to Vim. I tried it, but I just couldn't get into it. But I understood the power of Vim with its key bindings and shortcuts.

Text ediotrs made me realize the power of simplicity combined with a few plugins, it could be as powerful as an IDE yet lighter and faster.

I've tried a lot of different code editors over the years. I've used Sublime Text, Atom, Brackets, and even Visual Studio. But, I always loved VS Code. It's simple, lightweight, and has a ton of extensions that make it a great code editor.

# Getting Started

The first thing is to install Visual Studio Code. You can download it from the [Visual Studio Code website](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

I also typically like signing in with my Microsoft account. This allows me to sync my settings across all my devices.

# Settings

You can customize VS Code to fit your needs with settings as well.

You can access the settings in two ways -- JSON and UI. And you can apply your settings for your user or a specific project/workspace.

To visit your settings, you can go to File > Preferences > Settings. Or you can use the keyboard shortcut `CMD + ,` on Mac or `CTRL + ,` on Windows.

Another way is through the Command Palette. You can open the Command Palette with `CMD + SHIFT + P` on Mac or `CTRL + SHIFT + P` on Windows. Then type `settings` and select `Preferences: Open Settings (JSON)` or `Preferences: Open Settings (UI)`.

Here's an example of the JSON settings I have for Typescript

```json
"[typescriptreact]": {
    "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode",
    "editor.formatOnSave": true,
    "editor.tabSize": 2
  },
  "[typescript]": {
    "editor.tabSize": 2,
    "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode",
    "editor.formatOnSave": true
  },
  "typescript.preferences.importModuleSpecifier": "relative",
```

# Conclusion

VS Code is a powerful tool that can be used as alternative to IDEs. I like to keep things simple and clean, occasionaly checking my extensions and removing ones I don't use anymore. I hope this post helps you get started with VS Code and find some extensions that you like.
